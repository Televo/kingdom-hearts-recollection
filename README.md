### Kingdom Hearts Re:Collection is a free archive of art assets and custom fonts created by Televo.

Re:Collection contains hundreds of unique icons and fonts inspired from across the series, including worlds, combat abilities, key items, progression events and more. Icons can be classified into two artistic styles: DETAILED flashy artwork and MINIMAL coloured symbols.

This archive is known for being featured in the majority of trackers, randomizers and in numerous modded projects throughout the community.

If you decide to use these assets and fonts publicly, giving credit is much appreciated although not necessary. No doubt my time spent here exceeds 2000 hours so if you cherish what I do with all your heart, consider supporting me. Of those who have already done so, I am tremendously thankful.

Feel free to contact me anytime via Email (`televo.kh@gmail.com`) or Discord (`Televo#9400`). And I hope my efforts here help you to create something magnificent.

Fonts in Re:Collection are recreated faithfully, directly from the games where possible (such as KHTitle which pulls its characters from The World That Never Was). They also have improved letter spacing (specifically when setting spacing to metric, not optical).
    
Various languages are supported including English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Turkish, Polish, Norwegian, Swedish, Russian, Portuguese, Danish, Indonesian and other latin-based languages.
    
As the Scalan language hasn't been fully deciphered KHScala & KHScalaScirpt does contain translation inaccuracies.
